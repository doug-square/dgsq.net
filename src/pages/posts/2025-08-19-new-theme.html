Jekyll is great and all, but it sometimes feels a little <i>too</i> polished, bordering on bland.
</p>

<p>
I've been looking at some more bare-bones sites recently, and realizing that I tend to like the
feel of these when used for blogs and the like. In particular, I recently ran across
<a href="https://lunahd.neocities.org/">Miku's website</a>, and I thought that it seemed great.
</p>

<p>
So I stole it. And then changed the colorscheme. And then added a basic blogging functionality
to the site generator so that I can easily write posts.
</p>

<p>
If you like something about how this blog looks, please give all credit to Miku.
I'm at fault for anything you don't like.
</p>

<p>
Maybe someday I'll actually use this blog for something other than writing about this blog.
