<p>Not much of a point to this post. The blog should soon speak for itself.</p>

<p>I plan on writing mostly about technical topics, but who knows? These things can change.</p>

<p>This blog is currently using the <a href="https://beautifuljekyll.com/">Beautiful Jekyll</a>
theme, although the appearance may change slightly as I fine-tune.</p>
